Design:
    Using selenium because this year's leaderboards requires a button press?
    Cummulative time over segments to smooth them over
        This unfortunately doesn't put much weight on short segments

Possible Issues:
    Algorithm doesn't really make sense if early in the year

Future changes:
    Switch to PhantomJS instead of Chrome
